# BangoodScraper
Bangood Scrapper using python and bs4

Kindly use it at your own risk, this is intended for learning purpose.

Currently what it does:
1. Can scrap only a single page at a time (you'll have to provide the next url you want to scrap)
2. Can scrap the product name, product url, old price, new price (if any discounts)



Currently what it can't:
1. Cannot save the data (i have planned to export it to csv)
2. It can't traverse the pages i.e. cannot go to the pages 2,3,4,etc.. (too sad for a scrapper :( , but yeah man i am learning )
3. There are no anti-scrapping techniques, but hey, you tomo can try ;)
